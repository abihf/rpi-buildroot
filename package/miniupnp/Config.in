	  Compiled on a x86 PC, the miniupnp client library has less than 50KB code size.
	  The miniUPnP daemon is much smaller than any other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.
	  It also uses only ONE process and no additional thread, does not use any system() or exec() call, and therefore keeps system resources usage very low.
